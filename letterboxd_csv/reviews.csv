2021-03-15,Gone with the Wind,1939,https://boxd.it/1IU1tp,2.5,,"It's over 80 years old at the last time I watched it. The South apologist nature of the film cannot be denied. However given that it's 80 years old it is an amazing piece of not just historical depiction but of a prominent viewpoint that's within living memory still.

The actress playing Scarlet is so good at showing utter contempt for the people that she's talking to. Her transformation through the film is pretty great to watch.

It's awfully long.",,2021-03-14
2021-03-17,Popcorn,1991,https://boxd.it/1JfOuN,3,,"I used to see this at Blockbuster when I was looking through the horror flicks and the cover always made me say nah. I finally watched it and I didn't think it was half bad. I especially thought the revenge plot of the killer was pretty damn funny and well done.

It definitely reminded me of revenge flicks like slaughter high from the '80s. If you're out to watch a horror movie that is meant to be just enjoyed and not seriously pursued or honestly scared by this is a good fit.",,2021-03-16
2021-03-18,Subspecies,1991,https://boxd.it/1JhseH,2,,This was kind of a wretched movie. I thought Twilight was the first instance of emo vampires but this one definitely had that going on. it also for no real explicable reason had the stop action guys from the gate in it. about the only redeeming thing I found in this movie was I really liked the funeral parade that reminded me of New Orleans and the ceremony towards the end where they check all the graves for undead by seeing if a white horse will jump over them. It was very bizarre and I didn't think I'd seen anything quite like that.,deleted,2021-03-17
2021-03-18,Paranormal Activity,2007,https://boxd.it/1JjjU9,3.5,,I'm a sucker for found footage type movies. I know trying to inject a camera into the situation can make it a little hooky sometimes and the story seem forced but in this case I feel like the reason to have a camera was quite well explained.

2021-03-19,City Lights,1931,https://boxd.it/1JsIeP,3,,"This is a hard one to judge. I have a real hard time with 90 minutes of a silent film, but choreographed physical comedy was quite good. I think it's funny because pantomiming and silent films rely completely on the idea of stereotypical characters and tropes to allow the simplistic gestures convey the meaning of the characters.

2021-03-22,The Mummy,1999,https://boxd.it/1JRBVd,4.5,,"While the CGI is showing it's age, everything else about this movie is just spot on for me. It doesn't hit any false notes for me. If it's trying for creepy, it gets it. If it's trying for swashbuckling and some romance that hits true too. If you are looking for an adventure movie about raiding some tombs for glory and treasure this is a great one. If you feel like raiding tombs is colonialist and gross, maybe skip it.",,2021-03-21
2021-03-22,Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,2019,https://boxd.it/1JU9Y5,4,,"I'm not crazy about the meandering story involving the manson family. I'm tired of fantasy history that terintino peddles. But there are two things I think this movie is amazing for doing. One is the sets are amazing, and bring me back to my childhood in southern california. It's eerie. It's a bit before my time but not enough for me to feel it bleeding through the screen and it was incredibly well done. The second is the whole scene around a bad guy part in a western tv show. It was just stunning acting. I was spellbound through the whole thing.",,2020-09-15

2021-05-19,Psycho,1960,https://boxd.it/1S1LeF,5,,"This movie scared the crap out of me when I was a little kid. Why I got to watch this as a little kid who knows. But that scene where the lady comes out of a side room and it's an overhead shot of the guy going up the stairs. Man.

Watched it now, still find it to be a great film. I do find the smoldering looks between the sister and the boyfriend to be a little odd. ",,

2021-05-25,The 10th Victim,1965,https://boxd.it/1STEJf,3,,"This had a lot of just odd future tripping going on in it. Sure, you could sign up to participate in some kind of crazy blood sport that just everyone else tolerated or something. But there was also some bizarre sun worshipping cult, this very strange obsession with marriage or how it's impossible to get out of, hiding your parents or else the government will take them away, and more and more I can't even enumerate it all. Just like how robocop had a dozen different little commercials or peeks into what life was like in the near future, this was the same. Evidently, people in the near future think it's a good idea to sign up to be a hunter and prey without being a very good shot. This seems like a very bad idea.

The story itself is good enough to spruce up and reshoot. I thought the acting and everything going on was pretty good. Special effects were really not present. There's a bit of an old fashioned thread running through where two people that seem to fight a lot eventual tumble into bed and then get married at gunpoint. Other than that, it was a fun sci-fi story.",,
2021-05-25,1408,2007,https://boxd.it/1STRjf,3.5,,"I think this is a pretty awesome movie. Gave me shivers and reminds me why I like horror movies. It did go on a bit too long with the toying with the dude's emotions, but still. Pretty good.",,

I'm saying all that because this movie is 100% great. It has a story that I found really fun and engaging, the animation is just beautiful, and I love the characters in it. So well done!",,2021-05-27
2021-05-28,The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,1990,https://boxd.it/1Tchst,1.5,,Watching this I felt like I was being included in someone's fetish fantasy without permission. How can one man be so man?

2021-05-31,And Then There Were None,1945,https://boxd.it/1TAHUh,2.5,,"This is an ok adaptation of the book, acted well enough. There were some changes of who the characters were and what they did. The characters of the Doctor and the Butler were pretty strong characters, dramatic. What I would consider the main characters came across as rather bland, especially Lombard.

I don't think I cared for the change from the book, and unfortunately the film quality when I watched it made it tough to get through. Still, it's a good story told well, so I'm cool with saying 'meh'. ",,

2021-05-31,Chopping Mall,1986,https://boxd.it/1THbJb,2,,"Oh this was pretty much nonsense. I don't remember when malls sold AR-15s but I guess that was a thing. I also was pretty tripped out when a plot plate was a cigarette machine and I had forgotten all about those. There really wasn't much chopping at all as noted in a few other reviews.

2021-06-01,Alone in the Dark,1982,https://boxd.it/1TMXyZ,3,,"This one is a bit slow and feels unfocused to me a bit. However, I think the actors portraying the crazed inmates really were quite disturbingly portrayed. Also, I love that there's a major power outage to add to the ambiance of the movie. If you're looking for a reason or motive for the killers, I couldn't find one. There seems to be a bit of commentary on society with this movie where we ask the question, who's really crazy after all? Are these escaped inmates really much worse than some of the rest of society, especially when the power is off?

Props for the scene where the inmate's under the bed, it was well done and I like how it's not tied up nice and neat at the end.",,
2021-06-02,American Gothic,1987,https://boxd.it/1TVMHf,3,,"This one is a slow burning affair. It's trying to go for a creepy atmospheric vibe. Kind of like children of the corn, but instead of killer kids it's killer adults acting like kids. With some super religion thrown in.

The overall premise, kids stumble into some isolated community of crazy people is not very original but the details are definitely different. The ending I thought was going for a Chainsaw Massacre type thing but it went a different way for sure.",,
2021-06-02,It Happened at Lakewood Manor,1977,https://boxd.it/1TWqnJ,1,,"I should probably give it only half a star, it was super dull and they're ants.

I haven't seen silliness like this since 'The Day After Tomorrow' when I watched people run away from cold.",,
2021-06-06,Dune,1984,https://boxd.it/1Uvh23,3,,"My dad was a big fan of the books and took me to see this movie when I was maybe 12, so I think even watching it now I have a bit of nostalgia that is bringing up the rating. This is a weird take on the story, it adds a few oddities that I'm not sure improve the story. I especially watching as an adult don't care for how Jessica is kind of sidelined compared to how strong and capable she's in the book.

The effects look a little hokey and the director seems really fascinated with flowing sand. I think it's the most coherent David Lynch film I've watched yet.",,2021-06-05
2021-06-09,1984,1956,https://boxd.it/1UTqat,3,,"This is a pretty straight forward adaptation of the book, but I felt like the romance between Winston and Julia was played up probably as was customary for the times.

The main villain is quite good, acted very well and damned wicked. I would never have fessed up to having a side piece on Big Brother to that dude. Winston was nuts.",,
2021-06-10,Angels with Dirty Faces,1938,https://boxd.it/1V0su5,4,,"James Cagney really looks strange to me, like he's got extra bumps sticking out where I'm not used to seeing them in a face. 

The movie had a decent plot, it was well acted and other than the romantic storyline kind of being just a loose end I thought it was a fairly tight bit of storytelling. Well, except for the boy's basketball game with one team not knowing the rules at all. That was just for funsies I guess.

I had great sympathy for the main character until he decided that he wanted to return to a gangster life. It seemed like he was like the guy from 'Payback' who just wanted what was owed him and everyone kept trying to kill him or cheat him and he just wants what is owed. But then he decides to leverage his information instead of just disappearing and starting over and while it's quite human and believable it was dumb.

Anyways, surprisingly good film with people doing things you'd expect real people to do made 80 some years ago. That was quite a treat.",,
2021-06-15,Ready or Not,2019,https://boxd.it/1VEhG5,5,,"I won't spoil anything. If you want a black comedy/horror adjacent type of film with a story that's pretty original watch this.

2021-06-21,The Ten Commandments,1923,https://boxd.it/1Wmi3h,1,,"It's just not my bag. It's silent, it's super religious, and the back half of this longer than star wars movie is just a look into ""modern"" life and application of christian belief. I bump it up half a star because it looks like huge set pieces and I can respect that. But you know those little movie clips you saw in Columbia when playing Bioshock Infinite, imagine watching those for two hours. Praise be.",,
2021-06-21,I Wake Up Screaming,1941,https://boxd.it/1WqpTn,3,,"A detective movie, I see from other reviews the ""noir"" word gets thrown around a lot. 3 guys find a lady in a diner and decide to pull a trading places routine on her without the someone falling from grace part. When she makes it, she is set to leave for hollywood and gets killed before she goes. 1 of the 3 guys is getting pegged for the murder, but he claims innocence and falls in love with the victim's sister who I guess he really didn't think about until after her sister died.

There's some pretty pushy hulk of a cop that really wants the dude to fry for it. He plays that part well. I think the lead man is lacking a bit compared to some of the other leading stars I've seen in this era but he's alright. 

I give it a slightly better than 'meh'. I don't like it when detective movies pull the real killer out of nowhere, so I dock some points for that.",,

I've seen several of the wax museum type films but this is by far the earliest one so maybe it's first? Notable is a motivation for the main baddie to be doing what he's doing instead of ""he's just a crazy person"" so I liked that. I liked that it had a female protagonist, evidently a lady who liked to party and didn't want to bother showing up for work. Also there's this bit in the middle where she's scared of and runs from a frog. For some reason that cracked me up.

I think the aliens are wearing like gray star trek outfits with some crazy collars. They seem to be into stealing blood. Also, they seem to be into each other quite a lot. Everyone seems really horny.

Dude got LAZERED! He really acted that well. 

I've been to the lake as a teenager with my friends. We evidently missed out on sexually assaulting each other so much.

There are two older mechanics that are overpowering and killing people for the aliens, for a handful of quarters. The aliens said it was gold but it was clearly quarters. What the hell was that.

I got no beef with the set, a bit of complaints around special effects particularly blood effects and it seems well acted. No one stood out as being crappy and I liked bits here or there.

The story makes this one just be an ok film. No one's motives were really clear and nothing people did made sense. Especially the hero, while being a gritty heroic type, why? What was the point of this dude murdering tons of folks? Why did the two feuding clans really need the push to kill each other?

In the middle of the movie (after the wedding) things change gear and then it's a mystery as a red headed women and some dude with (so far) a snake is out messing about.

There's no one here to really cheer for except the new wife, imo. This movie doesn't end well if that's who you are cheering for sadly. 

I give it higher marks than I should simply because this story seems pretty wild and it's not yet another rehash of something to have an excuse to show naked women.

I felt like given the script's cheesiness, the ships and props and stuff are pretty good. The costumes are pretty terrible, you have to really just roll with it there. Also, I'm pretty sure the ship has boobs or maybe balls. It's a really organic looking ship, may be it's a Rorschach test.

Evil step-mom kicks Arnold's ass with a piano.

The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he didn't exist. First I heard it to great effect in 'The Usual Suspects' and now it's repeated here for less impact. Although I can say the temptation scene was decent. I read some reviews about scenery chewing, but I've seen devil's advocate. This was pretty good. 

Also, Arnold tricked the devil so he's got that going for him. Devil tricks him back. Then crucifies him.

The abstract makes sense and might be a good movie. The devil is always in the details, and this movie has so many details.  Other reviews have referred to 'fever dream' 'bizarre' 'disgusting' and, yeah.  That's on point.

I saw this in the theaters, as a high schooler. Even then, when the bizarre and crude humor should have probably had its best chance of landing I thought this was a crappy movie. And if you look at my review history, I know crappy movies.  I don't know if it's the top down unlikeable characters that fill the movie top to bottom. I don't know if it's the fun house nonsense that permeates the movie. I don't know if it's the 'ha-ha' way they treat giant mutant babies or a machine that rends flesh from bones. But it's something around the complete lack of tone for how you are supposed to be taking in this movie that makes it so terrible and bizarre and frankly I'm shocked any of the people involved worked again.

I read through some other reviews, and I agree that it's a horror movie that doesn't fit into a good bucket and so it's hard to figure out what the target audience is. I'm happy I watched it and it does such a good job talking about what it's like to be a kid (at least what I remember of it) but the ending makes it so that I would think you should be older to handle it.",,

You can see a revisiting of small town smallness in his book 'Needful Things', where he burns everything down like Inglorious Bastards.

Anyways, this seems like a well-produced made for TV movie. No cursing, no nudity, jump cut when things are going to get anything like violent. It's kinda dull and not really too memorable. You don't need these things to make a good movie but this is just a bit too cheesy to get into.

Best scene I think is when the gravedigger returns to the teachers house. It's creepy in the book and they got some of the creepiness I think in the movie well.

Unreal. This movie lays out so much of the inter-department fighting, the racism that leads to poor decisions, the terrible American foreign policy and hubris that led to 9/11 and more.

After thinking about it a bit, I really liked the horror of the devil's bargain made in the first one, that was a bit unusual in the genre I feel while this was just a 'kids up to no good unleash a monster they can't understand' movie which is a well worn path for a story.

I dock it half a star because I think the assault as a plot point makes me shy away from whole heartedly recommending it as a family film.

I am a child of the 80s, so my rating is quite tainted by my still being able to look at Marty in the 80s and saying ""That is now, the stuff from the 50s is the past"" which I think is important for some jokes to land. I think this is a great movie, It's effects still look pretty good (shockingly) and I really like the touches they put on Marty's travels affecting lots of little things not just the parents destinies.

I know the ending hits a little weird, thinking that George has kept his wife's would-be rapist just hanging about as a peon to belittle. I never even really thought about it until this most recent viewing, I thought it was important to show how the evil person got his comeuppance. The role-reversal is used to show how the present has been changed for the better in a pat neat way. This series doesn't invite too much deep thought about how time travel would really work and instead just provides entertainment.

We might know someone (or maybe we are the someone) who is so burnt out on the world that they think they would take this deal of unfathomable suffering just to feel something.

It's a product of the time in that the terrorists are caricatures because they are in Florida walking around with scarves wrapped around faces and heads like they are expecting a sandstorm or something. This is Arnold at his peak I think and I really like Jamie Lee Curtis in it as well.

A couple of random things about my relationship to this movie:

1) I have stayed at the hotel where they shot this when I was about to ship out to basic training. It was only a couple years after the filming of the movie so I heard about it multiple times.

2) I met Tom Arnold at a book signing that I was dragged to by a work acquaintance. When my friend from work gushed about this movie, he seemed kinda annoyed which I thought was funny since I couldn't think of something else in his career he'd like to be famous for.

I'm deleting this, it's not worth the 5-10 minutes where Jamie Lee Curtis decides she wants to do something with her life and gets her mojo and makes Arnold get all flustered. Everything else is kinda dumb. I mean, they took a horse up in an elevator to chase a guy on a motorcycle on the roof.  They nuke Florida.  Harriers have a significant role in the third act.

This tracks pretty close to the book, which I had the misfortune to read when I was younger. I give it an extra half star for being all dramatic and shit. Plus, I thought it was pretty funny when that lady whipped the guy across the face for not wanting to be a fuck boi.  But as a story it's super garbage.

I can't help but make a similar joke to what others are saying about having seen this once before and literally remembering nothing about it. I can't put my finger on what makes it so forgettable, it seems competently acted, the effects are nice, the sound is good (the drones especially have rich terrifying sounds). I usually do not guess what's happening in the movie but this I couldn't help but realize where it was going pretty earlier on, maybe that's the bummer?

Who knows. Tom Cruise is fixing drones and machinery while humanity extracts the last natural resources from our dying world after an alien invasion is successfully repulsed. The twist is revealed mid-movie, and the why of the twist is revealed towards the end. The end I dislike as it ignores sacrifices made.

The premise is based on true story where Ms. Winchester felt guilty at profiting from selling weapons and felt haunted in some way by the spirits killed by repeating rifles. If they had kept with the atmospheric hauntings and spooks, added more creepy in there I think this could have been a pretty good movie.

Castaway, Gravity, I am Legend come to mind. This movie is kinda a horror movie version of those kinds of films, but instead of it being man vs. nature, nature is played by a crazy dude in a yellow truck.

2024-11-03,The House by the Lake,1976,https://boxd.it/7I87JZ,2,,"This is a slow paced well deserved revenge movie with a couple of oddities from the usual 'I spit on your grave' kinda fare.  Looked at without really paying close attention and it's just a car full of men doing the home invasion/rape/murder kinda thing. Which I kinda don't understand as a genre but it's there, especially in the 70s. I think this was before we had slasher films, and you can see the prototype there a bit. Senseless violence and death that you can only stop through violence. Anyways, the differences from most revenge flicks to me were:

1) There is a pretty long build up to the part where the mayhem starts. The story is a dentist is taking a lady out to an isolated country estate to force himself on her. Pleasant. But this not really couple pisses off some locals on the way out to the isolated house and these guys descend with murderous and rapey intent. The dentist gets the brunt of this and is damsel in distress in this movie.

2) While the main baddie is forcing himself on the lady who emasculated him by beating him racing cars, she stops fighting suddenly and the guy notices and asks why she stopped. She for a moment seems to genuinely be interested in amorous advances all of a sudden and they are interrupted. This was a really odd moment, and kinda gross.

3) The main baddie has some interesting ideas to push while defiling the dentist's house. He posits that the dentist doesn't care what these guys do to the girl or even his person, but he cares deeply about the nice things he's acquired in this sexual assault headquarters out in the middle of nowhere. This insight is also a really odd moment, but interesting to think about.

4) Lastly, when all is said and done, the final (only?) girl has triumphed, she has flashbacks to the moment described in 2 and the movie ends there. Like she's going to be thinking about that hot time she almost got raped for the rest of her life and maybe she shouldn't have killed all those dudes because they looked kinda sweet if you squint. It was a big wtf moment for me.

I'll be honest, the woman in this is a complex and strong character mostly, and maybe I just don't have the right perspective on what they are trying to say with this film. Or maybe it's just trashy revenge. I don't. know. I give it 2 stars.",deleted,2024-11-02

The backdrop, the war that is being covered is a fictitious one in the US and I feel like this is getting the focus instead of the experience of getting the money shot or quote.  

I do think that's it is trying to say something about what it would be like if the US had another civil war, what that would look like with everyday people, small towns, militias coming out of the woodwork, the tired murder that happens when the end is so close.

The amount of things that are flying into the camera are obscene.

This version of the story changes a few things about the end, in my opinion not for the better. I will say 
- Kids in animal masks up to solemn things is pretty creepy and a nice weird touch.
- The final scene with the little boy in the car is a gut punch to me. It was almost as horrible as the ending of the Mist.

Instead of inventing facebook and the iPhone and ruining life as we know it, we took alien tech and built a bunch of weapons. The things on display in this movie that is also set to present day-ish if the world took their entire GDP and put it into making space stuff.

There's also a part where there was like random people laughing and then it cut away to a boat at see where some dude was up in crow's nest laughing and yelling Merry Christmas, it was crazy. I was reminded of that scene in Planes Trains and Automobiles where they almost wreck and then John Candy for a hot second is wearing a devil's outfit for no reason.",,2024-12-06

So, I announced that every year on Thanksgiving night our family will watch one of the Sharknado movies. My 10 year old boys were kind of into it.

I thought this was a pretty funny movie with decent action and silliness and I am a fan of my tradition now. My rating is with me going in knowing it's a stupid premise and probably going to be a dumb film. It's how much fun I had with the experience of watching it.",,2024-12-06

The amount of crazy criminal activity that is on display here is high. I guess because it's all white girls it's cool? IDK, I felt deeply uncomfortable watching this basically the whole time.

It's not unwatchable and it's not just stupid so I can't give it 1 star. But it's really not ok in a lot of ways.",,2024-12-06

The dude-icity of this movie is off the charts. Val Kilmer gives probably his best performance of his life by a mile. You get to hear someone say the word ""huckleberry"" with menace you didn't think was possible saying ""I'll kill you right now""",,2024-12-06

I'll be honest, I've never been a huge fan of the effects in the original I thought they just looked cheesy and gross. These looks fake CGI and a bit gross. I felt it still had a good amount of tension as they realize what's happening and what could be among them. The alien among us gimmick was what made the original be so good to me and this one still had that feel.

It had a bit more of action/adventure feel to it in some places, so maybe that's what was bumming people out? IDK, this is a decent flick.",,2024-12-06

If I hadn't seen the Ring this would have been rated higher but I feel like it would always lose out in stack ranking so would I ever watch this again. Probably not.

Great story of power politics and illegal wars with our favorite boy scout Jack Ryan. The only reason I think the US hasn't already sent covert teams into Columbia is because I don't think anyone really cares about the war on drugs, it's just a pretense.

The version I had didn't come with chinese subtitles so about a quarter of the movie was kinda a guess about what was going on. But it's not hard to figure out the basic plot. Australian and US mercenaries act like adventurers that are completing a quest and don't want to do the side quest of save the buncha dudes in a pit. Their local guides don't like this and are left to die. Unlikely team up and some chinese rich lady (?) take out the baddies with a ton of kickboxing style stuff. Lots of flying knees and kicks.

It seemed to have about 3 or 4 sequences of events that were happening interleaved which made it very disjointed. Maybe on purpose?

I find Sasha Gray to be really cold and her range seems to be emotionless to mean when acting. That made it tough to slog through too. 

I guess if you are squinting it might be saying something about capitalism  turning all of us into transactional beings and we're all trading ourselves to get ahead. But that might just be my filter on a hyper-capitalistic transactional movie. Who knows.",deleted,2024-12-13

The villagers told you it was a vampire movie the moment it started. This dude was willfully just listening to his dick and ignoring everything until the fangs came out for him.

Give +1/2 star for the dude going union strong in the face of adversity. Also, they seem to think that this movie is so good that it needs to have another movie inside this movie.

The acting level on this I expect it to break into straight up porn. I have no idea how this ended up on my plex, but it's gotta go now. I think the mafia princess is probably the best actor in this thing. Everyone else is quite wooden.",deleted,2024-12-16

The killer was pretty creepy and I appreciate that until the last moments of the film he's just well practiced, not like a superhuman or anything. I like who ends up saving the day. While probably realistic, the little girls freaking out and screaming all the time was annoying as hell, cost the movie at least half a star I'm sure.

I like that this is just something that happened, no reason or cause, just random violence. To me, that makes it more realistic and more scary so good on the movie for that.

Yeah, I don't like movies that have kids as the major focus of the movie anymore so I think that's what keeps me from giving this a heart and maybe an extra star. ",deleted,2024-12-16

- It's super derivative.  The story tracks with Carrie a lot, although the revenge part is drawn out and the bulk of the film. The main character is a huge rip-off of the daughter in Beetlejuice. Both of these things are super distracting and take away from what could have been the lure of evil power to a girl that's been picked on and bullied her whole life.
- The ending is WTF. Like literally the last 5 minutes or so make it seem like maybe it was a dream all along, or the friend to the troubled Carrie stand-in was the real crazy person all along and she imagined everything at the bidding of the mirror. Or something. IDK, it was super out of the blue to me.

I liked the start where it jumps you right into the group of slutty college kids that have had their first encounter with a killer something in a marsh. Great. Then they take refuge in an empty house and it's like they forget that they left a couple of their friends for dead in the woods. Same thing happens when a dude breaks from the party and goes to town to get help and acts like he's just had a rough time. It's dumb. When he asks for a ride, he fails to convey the serious nature of the mission to extract his friends. It's all as stupid as can be.
